# 🛍️ Amazon Clone – HTML & CSS Only

Welcome to my Amazon Clone project!  
This is a frontend-only replica of the Amazon homepage, built using **pure HTML5 and CSS3**. It was created as part of my web development learning journey, inspired by Apna College’s hands-on tutorials.

I carefully followed each step, understood how Amazon’s layout works, and recreated it myself without using any frameworks or backend technologies.
